# War with cards

My son 6 year old son became interested in the card game war. This inspired me to practice OOP in python and create an interactive card game for war. I have few ideas of what this program will do. First is a command line game that two or more players can play. Second is a simulation mode that can be used to conduct analysis on the game. I also seek to change the rules to the game and offer an alternative game that maybe more interesting.
